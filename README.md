# Automatic-Solution-for-Rat-and-Maze-problem
This code will automatically find the solution for rat and maze problem for any given maze using backtracking algorithm.

The following libraries / modules are necessary for executing this code:
1) tkinter
2) nummpy
3) sys
4) time
5) termocolor
6) PIL (Python Imaging Library)

The user gives the dimension of the maze, the source positon (rat's position) and the destination position (cheese's position) as the input.
Using the dimension given by the user, a maze is formed randomly using "random" module.
The code generates the solution (path) for this problem using backtracking algorithm and displays it to the user using GUI.

The function names in the code are self-explanatory of what the function does.
The "direction" function is where the solution for the problem is found using backtracking algorithm. The other functions are used to create, structure the maze and adding images and GUI.
